IRC Client written in C++ as a training model to attempt to reteach myself the cpp language. It's never intended that this will ever
get used on a daily basis or by anyone but me... for a very short time. I really don't even use IRC that much anymore. The reason
I decided to go with an IRC client as opposed to anything else is that it is fairly well-rounded in a lot of aspects. There is need
for input, output, sockets and much more. There is user interaction, system interaction and internet communication. I have written an
IRC client in the past using VB6 so I do have experience in this area which should make things a little easier. The IRC RFC is
open and pretty damn simple as well.

The original plan was to jump right in and make this with a GUI and the full works... but yeah I was pretty lost. I never got too
good at cpp. So like I've said many times throughout my life, some times you need to resort to "stick to the basics". So starting
from scratch we will begin with a console program that is going to be extremely annoying and no where near a realistic choice to
use for more than just debug, testing and diagnostics. I don't know if it will ever get an ncurses UI before the GUI comes. Chances
are that this project will not even get completed... ever. Just kind of how it works out sadly enough.
